    "Question": "An organization is designing its network infrastructure using Zero Trust principles. Which core tenet requires all assets and workflows to be continuously verified before being granted or keeping access to data or applications?",
    "A": "Assume all network connections are insecure",
    "B": "Limit the \"Blast Radius\"",
    "C": "Access Limitation",
    "D": "Continuous Verification",
    "Answer": "D",
    "AnswerText": "Continuous Verification",
    "Domain": "Security architecture",
    "ExplanationText": "Continuous Verification is correct because Zero Trust requires constant validation of users, devices, and sessions before granting or maintaining access. Assuming all connections are insecure focuses on initial trust assumptions, not ongoing checks. Limiting the blast radius means reducing impact from breaches, and Access Limitation is a vague control rather than a core Zero Trust tenet."
