# Quiz Application

A command-line quiz application I developed for practicing CompTIA Security+ exam questions. 
This could be used for other multiple-choice quizzes as well. See below for details, 
specifically the expected format of the questions JSON file. It loads questions from a JSON 
file, presents them in random order, and tracks user scores over time.

## Features
- Loads questions from a JSON file (`questions_main.json`).
  - NOTE: The example question bank here is not guaranteed to be accurate, although I've made my best effort. Use at your own risk.
- Randomizes question order and answer options for varied practice.
- Displays the correct answer (`AnswerText`) for both correct and incorrect responses to reinforce learning.
- Saves quiz results to a JSON file, including:
  - Timestamp
  - Score and total questions
- Supports command-line arguments for customizing the quiz file, number of questions, and scores file.
- Interactive mode for selecting the number of questions if not specified.
- Error handling for file loading, JSON validation, and user input.

## Requirements
- Python 3.6+ (built and tested on 3.10)
- No external dependencies

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/cw-roy/security_plus_quizzer.git
   cd security_plus_quizzer
   ```
2. Ensure `questions_main.json` is in the project directory or provide a path to your own question file.

## Usage
Run the script with default settings:
```bash
python3 main.py
```

### Command-Line Arguments
- `-f, --file`: Path to the questions JSON file (default: `questions.json`).
- `-n, --num`: Number of questions to ask (optional; prompts interactively if omitted).
- `-s, --scores`: Path to the scores JSON file (default: `scores.json`).

Example:
```bash
python3 main.py --file questions_master.json --num 20 --scores history.json
```

### Input JSON Format
The script expects a JSON file with the following structure:
```json
{
  "questions": [
    {
      "Question": "Question text",
      "A": "Option A",
      "B": "Option B",
      "C": "Option C",
      "D": "Option D",
      "Answer": "A",
      "AnswerText": "Option A"
    },
    ...
  ]
}
```

### Output
- Questions are displayed with shuffled options (A, B, C, D).
- Immediate feedback is provided ("Correct!" or "Incorrect. Correct answer: X").
- Final score is displayed as `score/total (percentage%)`.
- Scores are saved to the specified scores file with metadata.

### Scores File Format
The scores file (`scores.json`) stores quiz results as a list of entries:
```json
[
  {
    "date": "2025-10-22T12:30:00.123456",
    "score": 18,
    "total": 20,
  },
  ...
]
```
- I will probably add functionality for reviewing incorrect answers at some point. 

## Example Interaction
```
How many questions? (1-90): 3

Score: 2/3 (66.7%)
Score saved to scores.json
```

## Development
- **Testing**: Test with `questions_main.json` to ensure compatibility. Verify score saving with multiple runs and check handling of corrupted scores files.
- **Extending**: Add features like question category filtering or retrying incorrect questions by modifying the `run_quiz` function.
