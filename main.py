Quiz Application
A command-line quiz application I built for practicing CompTIA Security+ exam 
questions. This could be used for other multiple-choice quizzes as well. See the
README for details, specifically the expected format of the questions JSON file.

The application loads questions from a JSON file, presents them in random order,
and tracks user scores over time.

Usage:
    python main.py [-f FILE] [-n NUM] [-s SCORES]

Example:
    python main.py --file questions_main.json --num 20 --scores history.json
